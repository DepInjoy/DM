    "# WeRateDogs推特的狗狗的数据清洗和分析\n",
    "\n",
    "## 项目简介\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs 是一个推特主，他以诙谐幽默的方式对人们的宠物狗评分。这些评分通常以 10 作为分母。但是分子则一般大于 10：11/10、12/10、13/10 等等。为什么会有这样的评分？因为 \"They're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs 拥有四百多万关注者，曾受到国际媒体的报道。本项目的目的是对包含了截止到 2017 年 4 月 1 日的 5000 多条推特数(推特 ID、时间戳、推特文本等)进行数据清洗，并创建分析和可视化。"

    "## 背景\n",
    "你的目标：清洗 WeRateDogs 推特数据，创建有趣且可靠的分析和可视化。这份推特档案很棒，但是只包含基本的推特信息。要达到 \"Wow!\" 的效果，在分析和可视化前，还需要收集额外的数据、然后进行评估和清洗。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 数据\n",
    "\n",
    "### 完善推特档案\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs 的推特档案包括 5000 多条推特的基本信息，但并不包括所有内容。不过档案中有一列包含每个推特的文本，我用这一列数据提取了评分、狗的名字和“地位”（即 doggo、floofer、pupper 和 puppo）——这使数据得以“完善”。在这 5000 多条中，我只筛选出了 2356 条包含评分的推特数据。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 通过推特 API 获取附加数据\n",
    "\n",
    "回到基础的推特档案：转发数（retweet count）和喜爱数（favorite count）是两个遗漏的列。幸运的是，从推特 API 中，任何人都可以收集到这些数据。其实，\"任何人\" 只是能获取最多 3000 条的最近推特数据。但是因为你拥有 WeRateDogs 推特档案和其中的推特 ID，你可以收集到这其中所有的 5000 多条推特。你将查询推特 API 来收集这些有价值的数据。\n",
    "\n",
    "特别提示： 如果你无法访问 Twitter 的话，我们将直接给你提供返回的 Twitter 数据。你可以 右键点击这里选择另存为 下载。该文件为 txt 格式，每一行为一条独立的 twitter 信息，格式为 JSON。该文件比较大，下载可能需要几分钟。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 图像预测文件\n",
    "\n",
    "还有一件更酷的事情：我通过一个可以对狗狗种类进行分类的神经网络，运行这份推特档案中的所有图像。获取的结果：一份图像预测结果表格，其中包含了预测结果的前三名，推特 ID，图像 url 以及最可信的预测结果对应的图像编号（由于推特最多包含 4 个图片，所以编号为 1 到 4）。\n",
    "以该表格中的最后一行数据来理解各列数据：\n",
    "\n",
    "tweet_id 是推特链接的最后一部分，位于 \"status/\" 后面 → https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/889531135344209921\n",
    "jpg_url 是预测的图像资源链接\n",
    "img_num 最可信的预测结果对应的图像编号 → 1 推特中的第一张图片\n",
    "p1 是算法对推特中图片的一号预测 → 金毛犬\n",
    "p1_conf 是算法的一号预测的可信度 → 95%\n",
    "p1_dog 是一号预测该图片是否属于“狗”（有可能是其他物种，比如熊、马等） → True 真\n",
    "p2 是算法对推特中图片预测的第二种可能性 → 拉布拉多犬\n",
    "p2_conf 是算法的二号预测的可信度 → 1%\n",
    "p2_dog 是二号预测该图片是否属于“狗” → True 真\n",
    "以此类推...\n",
    "从推特中可以看到，对该图像的一号预测（p1）是准确的：\n",
    "所以这既有趣，也很不错。但是所有附加数据都需要收集、评估和清洗。所以才需要你。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 关键要点\n",
    "清洗这个项目的数据时要牢记几个要点：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 我们只需要含有图片的原始评级 (不包括转发)。尽管数据集中有 5000 多条数据，但是并不是所有都是狗狗评分，并且其中有一些是转发。\n",
    "- 完整地评估和清理整个数据集将需要大量时间，实践和展示数据处理技巧没有必要将这个数据集全部清理。因此，本项目的要求只是评估和清理此数据集中的至少 8 个质量问题和至少 2 个整洁度问题。\n",
    "- 根据 整洁数据 tidy data 的规则要求，本项目的数据清理应该包括将三个数据片段进行合并。\n",
    "- 如果分子评级超过分母评级，不需要进行清洗。这个 特殊评分系统 是 WeRateDogs 人气度较高的主要原因。（同样，也不需要删除分子小于分母的数据）\n",
    "- 不必收集 2017 年 8 月 1 日之后的数据，你可以收集到这些推特的基本信息，但是你不能收集到这些推特对应的图像预测数据，因为你没有图像预测算法的使用权限。\n",
